Lite - Lite Is (a) Tile Engine*
 * Name subject to change depending on how heavy the dependencies get ;)

A simple, lightweight, 2D tile-based platformer engine destined for windows/linux/osx.

Two main components:
C++:
  Graphics engine.
   * Tile map rendering _and_ logic (i.e. edges)
   * Entity rendering (generic objects in the world)
   * Any misc rendering, really
  Collision logic (hotspots2box, box2box, etc)
   * Physics? (ie. gravity etc)
     - This might best be suited to be implemented in script instead
       to facilitate finer customization from project-to-project.

Scripting Language (candidates: Ruby, Python, Lua, nasal, maybe Javascript):
(The scripting would be bound to the C++ engine which does all the "work", but
 scripting will control most of the game-world logic.)
  Bindings to load and unload maps/levels, graphics, sound, etc.
  Simple UI element creation system (for menus/HUD/debug/whatever)
   * Buttons, radial menus (for editor), etc.
  Entity class creation
    (ability to create new entity types which are tied to a base C++ type)
    (will need to implement the decorator pattern for this to work out prly)
