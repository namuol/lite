Big (and probably unfinished) list of features that should be implemented:

core:
 - Font support.
   * [DONE] Mapping to TextureGrid for pixel fonts
   * TTF et al support?
 - Debug output system that supports logfiles
 - Debug *build* system
 - Sound support
   * Music support (big, long samples which you can jump anywhere into/around)
   * SFX support (short samples that can loop and be positioned in stereo, etc)
