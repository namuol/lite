All directories here except "base" are specific implementations of the core graphics
and input engine.

Currently, there is only an implementation using SFML in the works, but that may
 change in the future if it proves to be too slow. For this reason, I'm keeping it
 seperate from the "base" folder to ease transitioning between implementations, with
 any hope.
